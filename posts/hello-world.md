# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Markdown. I can write content using **bold text**, *italics*, or even code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Features

- Markdown support
- Code syntax highlighting
- Modern design
- No database needed

Feel free to edit this file or create new `.md` files in the `posts` directory to add more blog posts!
